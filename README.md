# boxee-simulator
A simulator for the Boxee Box.

A desktop application, based on Qt Widgets 5.x, that provides the minimal set of functionalities required to test and demonstrate the iosBoxeeRemote application.

## UPDATE 

Work on boxee-simulator has been interrupted (and won't be resumed) due to the reasons described below.

As of June, 2019, some Boxee servers that were in charge of managing and authenticating Boxee accounts are no longer available. Boxee Boxes can no longer authenticate users and report they have no Internet Connection even when they are connected to a network that has access to the Internet. Further details about the issue can be seen 
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxee/comments/bzb2wn/boxee_can_not_connect_to_the_internet_nor_wifi_or/). 

My Boxee Box is currently unusable and, infering from what has been written on the discussion above, mine is not an exception. As all candidate fixes are too hacky for most users (including myself), I decided to let my beloved Boxee Box go and stop investing time and energy on both the [boxee-simulator](https://github.com/raulcostajunior/boxee-simulator) and a new version of [iOSBoxeeRemote](https://github.com/raulcostajunior/iosboxeeremote) that I had already started and would finish after concluding the first version of the simulator. 

R.I.P Boxee Box :(
