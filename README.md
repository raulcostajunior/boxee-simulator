# boxee-simulator
A simulator for the Boxee Box.

A desktop application, based on Qt Widgets 5.x, that provides the minimal set of functionalities required to test and demonstrate the iosBoxeeRemote application.

## UPDATE 

Work on boxee-simulator has been interrupted due to the reason described below.

As of June, 2019, some Boxee servers that were in charge of managing and authenticating Boxee accounts are no longer available. Boxee Boxes can no longer authenticate users and report they have no Internet Connection even when they are connected to a network that has access to the Internet. Further details about the issue can be seen 
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxee/comments/bzb2wn/boxee_can_not_connect_to_the_internet_nor_wifi_or/). 

My Boxee Box is currently unusable and, infering from what has been written on the discussion above, mine is not an exception. Until I find some time to test an easy hack to fix the situation (promissing one at https://gitlab.com/HazWard/boxee-server), I'll halt working on the Boxee Simulator.
